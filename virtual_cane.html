    <p> This device serves as a replacement to the traditional white cane visually impaired people
		   use to navigate around various obstacles in day to day life. The contraption attaches to the
		   user's chest and operates autonomously which also frees up both hands of the user which is 
		   advantageous to the traditional white cane.
