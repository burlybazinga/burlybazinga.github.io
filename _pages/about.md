I am currently in my 2A Term for Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo. As an ambitious individual I am always looking to expand my network, learn new things and follow my passion for new technologies whether it is software, mechanically or electrically oriented. 

Some of my personal interests outside of technology realm include following the NBA, European soccer leagues, astronomy, cyrtpocurrencies, reading (particularly historical fiction), trivia, working out and watching T.V. shows. 

My website features some of my favourite projects I have worked on. Feel free to also checkout my LinkedIn profile, Github profile or contact me by email at taandron@uwaterloo.ca.
