This project features a multi-level arcade game using Java on the Greenfoot platform. The use of gamestates allows for tracking of lives, asteroid/naval mine kills and shield usage. An intricate menu system was incorporated letting the user(s) pick between 1 and 2 player, navigate through instructions and see their score at the end of the game.
