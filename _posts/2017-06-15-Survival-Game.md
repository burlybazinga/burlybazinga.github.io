  <p> Below are pictures of the many different elements of the game I created using Java on the Greenfoot platform.
      This game features various gamestates allowing for transitions between levels, tracking lives, keeping count of
      asteroid/naval mine kills and an end game screen. Furthermore, there is an abundance of different classes, utilizing
      the versatility of object-oriented programming. An applet version of the game is available below the pictures. 
      Apologies if the applet does not run, many browsers have dropped applet support. Firefox, Safari and older Internet 
      Explorer versions generally yields the best results. I have also included the gfar project file, which can be opened
      with Greenfoot. </p>
