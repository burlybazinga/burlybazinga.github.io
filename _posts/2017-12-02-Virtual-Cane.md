    <p> This device serves as a replacement to the traditional white cane visually impaired people
 	use to navigate around various obstacles in day to day life. The contraption attaches to the
	user's chest and operates autonomously, freeing up both hands of the user which is 
	advantageous to the traditional white cane.

  <p> The virtual white cane operates by sweeping the area in front of the 
      user using 2 ultrasonic sensors
      and alerting them of incoming obstacles or changes in elevation with a sound notification. As the user
      gets closer to an obstacle, the frequency of beeps increases. The downward facing ultrasonic sensor
      detects changes in elevation. A gyroscope sensor attached to a hardhat worn on the user's head allows
      the system to rotate in unison with the user's head. This allows for checking in different directions
      for obstacles which is useful for turning or in busy areas.
